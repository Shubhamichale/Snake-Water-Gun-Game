A Python implementation of the Snake-Water-Gun game with scoring and high score tracking.

A simple Python implementation of the classic Snake-Water-Gun game (similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors), where you play 5 rounds against the computer, earn points for wins (+1), draws (0), and losses (-1), and try to beat your previous best score which is saved in a high-score file.
